This repository contains the relevant material corresponding to RL course's final assignment. The assignment consists of 
developing a deep reinforcement learning agent for the environment KAZ. As a simplification, only two agents are 
trained: one archer and one knight. Their goal is to cooperate to kill zombies and avoid zombies to reach the bottom 
of the screen. The agents are trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm.
#### Main features

- KAZ environment.
- Multi-agent environment.
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
- Experiment tracking with Weights & Biases.
- Freeze and play scheme.
